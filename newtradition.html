            Aggineers Assemble is a newfound tradition at Texas A&M University. It is the tradition to unite all upcoming Aggie freshmen who are interested in the <em>engineering program</em> Texas A&M prides itself on.
            Taking inspiration from other freshman traditions such as Fish Camp, upcoming Aggineers will feel welcomed to the campus, and understand the <em>Aggie spirit</em> while also preparing themselves for a successful first year.
            The tradition will not only introduce Aggie culture, but also provide information for Aggineers to learn about Engineering processes such as <mark>ETAM</mark> and some friendly advice that makes the ETAM process less intimidating.
