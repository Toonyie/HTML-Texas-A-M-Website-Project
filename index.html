                <p><b><i><u>Aggie Bonfire</u></i></b> was originally a scrap heap created by students in 1907. Originally, it was used before a football rivalry game between Texas A&M University and University of Texas.
            The scrap heap was primarily used to emphasize a clear motivation to defeat UT in a football game, emphasizing the <b><i><u>"burning desire"</u></i></b>. Afterwards, for the next few decades, Aggie bonfires were created and burned making it a tradition to symbolize the Aggie Spirit.
            However, on <b><i><u>November 18, 1999 at 2:42 a.m</u></i></b>, while the bonfire was being built, it spontaneously collapsed. Texas A&M students were caught in the collapse leading to 12 deaths and 27 injured. 
            As a result, the <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/campus-community/traditions/remembrance/bonfire-memorial.html" target="_blank">Bonfire Memorial</a> was created 5 years later in order 
            to commemorate those who have been involved in the <a href="https://stories.tamu.edu/news/2024/11/12/never-forgotten-25-years-after-bonfire-tragedy-texas-am-remembers-12-who-died/" 
            target="_blank">tragic incident</a>. Today, thousands of students as well as visitors to Texas A&M University attend the Bonfire Memorial tradition occuring at the same time and location every year.
